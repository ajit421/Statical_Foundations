# Progress

## What Works
The following modules are complete and functional:
- **Types_of_Data:** The notebook in this directory successfully demonstrates different types of data.
- **Sampling_Techniques:** This module's notebook covers various sampling methods with code examples.
- **Distributions_Of_Data:** The notebook illustrates different data distributions.
- **DistributionsContd:** This notebook continues the exploration of data distributions.
- **Central_Limit_Theorem:** The notebook provides a practical demonstration of the Central Limit Theorem.

## What's Left to Build
- The project currently covers a good range of foundational topics. Future work could involve adding more advanced statistical concepts, such as:
  - Hypothesis Testing
  - A/B Testing
  - Regression Analysis
  - Time Series Analysis

## Current Status
The project is in a stable state. The existing notebooks are complete and serve as a good resource for the topics they cover. The immediate next step is to ensure the Memory Bank is fully initialized.

## Known Issues
- There are no known issues with the existing notebooks.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- The project started as a collection of scripts and has evolved into a more structured set of Jupyter notebooks, each in its own directory. This change was made to improve organization and make the content easier to consume.
