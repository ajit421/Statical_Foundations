# Project Brief

## Project Name
Statistical Foundations

## Core Requirements
This project is a collection of Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts that explore fundamental concepts in statistics. The goal is to provide clear, code-based examples of topics like:
- Types of Data
- Sampling Techniques
- Data Distributions
- Central Limit Theorem

## Goals
- To create a well-documented and easy-to-understand resource for learning statistics.
- To use Python and popular data science libraries (like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to illustrate statistical concepts.
- To maintain a clean and organized codebase.
