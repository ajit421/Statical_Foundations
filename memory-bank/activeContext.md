# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
The current focus is on establishing the foundational documentation for the "Statistical Foundations" project by initializing the Memory Bank. This involves creating the core documentation files that will be used to track the project's status, architecture, and goals.

## Recent Changes
- `projectbrief.md` was created to define the project's name, core requirements, and goals.
- `productContext.md` was created to explain the project's purpose, the problems it solves, and its intended user experience.

## Next Steps
- Create `systemPatterns.md` to document the project's structure.
- Create `techContext.md` to outline the technologies used.
- Create `progress.md` to track the project's completion status.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- The Memory Bank files are being created with initial content based on the existing project structure. This content will be expanded upon as the project evolves.
- The documentation should be clear and easy to maintain.
